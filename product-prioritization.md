Here’s a concise yet clear explanation of each **product prioritization and research tool** you mentioned — **RICE**, **ICE**, **Kano model**, and **Stakeholder Interviews** — including their purpose and use cases:

---

## 🧮 1. **RICE Scoring Model**

**RICE** stands for **Reach**, **Impact**, **Confidence**, and **Effort**. It's a prioritization framework used to evaluate and compare product ideas or features.

| Factor         | Description                                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reach**      | How many users will this affect? (e.g., per quarter)                                   |
| **Impact**     | How much will this improve the user experience or business goals? (e.g., 1 to 3 scale) |
| **Confidence** | How confident are you in your estimates for reach and impact? (e.g., 0–100%)           |
| **Effort**     | Time or resources required to deliver this (e.g., person-months)                       |

### 🧠 Formula:

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

> ✅ **Use when:** You have a backlog of features and need a data-informed way to rank them.

## 🔢 2. **ICE Scoring Model**

**ICE** stands for **Impact**, **Confidence**, and **Ease**.

| Factor         | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Impact**     | How big is the positive outcome?            |
| **Confidence** | How sure are you about the impact and ease? |
| **Ease**       | How easy or quick is it to implement?       |

### 🧠 Formula:

```
ICE Score = (Impact × Confidence × Ease)
```

> ✅ **Use when:** You want a **quick, intuitive** method to prioritize without deep data gathering.

## 😊 3. **Kano Model**

The **Kano Model** is a user satisfaction framework that helps categorize features based on how they affect customer happiness.

| Category        | Meaning                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Must-Have**   | Expected features; absence causes dissatisfaction |
| **Performance** | The more you offer, the happier the customer      |
| **Delighters**  | Unexpected features that delight users            |
| **Indifferent** | Features that don’t affect satisfaction           |
| **Reverse**     | Features that may annoy certain users             |

> ✅ **Use when:** You want to balance core features, performance improvements, and innovations for maximum customer satisfaction.

## 🗣️ 4. **Stakeholder Interviews**

These are **qualitative discussions** with internal or external stakeholders (e.g., executives, customers, engineers) to gather input on product strategy, needs, pain points, or priorities.

### Goals:

* Understand business objectives
* Identify technical constraints
* Validate market problems or solutions
* Align roadmap with strategic priorities

> ✅ **Use when:** You're starting a new product, evaluating a pivot, or need alignment across teams.

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **RICE Scoring**           | Quantifying and comparing product opportunities   |
| **ICE Scoring**            | Quick, gut-based prioritization                   |
| **Kano Model**             | Understanding user satisfaction and feature value |
| **Stakeholder Interviews** | Gathering strategic input and aligning priorities |
