Certainly! Here's an expanded explanation of that recommendation, suitable for inclusion in a technical strategy document, architecture guide, or resume context:

**Use self-managed Kubernetes when an organization requires:**

* **Full control over infrastructure and configuration:**
  Self-managed Kubernetes (e.g., installed via kubeadm, Rancher, or kOps) allows complete customization of the control plane, networking stack, and worker node configuration. This is critical for enterprises with strict compliance, performance tuning, or OS-level customization requirements not easily achievable in managed services like EKS, GKE, or AKS.

* **Custom CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins and network policies:**
  Organizations needing advanced networking (e.g., Calico, Cilium for eBPF-based observability and security, or Multus for multi-interface support) benefit from the flexibility of self-managed Kubernetes. This setup allows tighter integration with SDNs, firewalls, and internal routing infrastructure.

* **Hybrid cloud or on-prem deployments:**
  For enterprises operating in hybrid environments — where workloads span cloud, on-prem data centers, and edge — self-managed Kubernetes enables consistent control plane architecture, avoids vendor lock-in, and supports legacy integration or air-gapped deployments.

* **Security and compliance requirements:**
  Organizations subject to stringent regulatory standards (e.g., FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) may require control over every component, including audit logs, encryption modules, and the ability to use custom security modules, hardened OS baselines, or FIPS-certified components — which are often restricted in managed services.

* **Advanced upgrade, backup, and disaster recovery strategies:**
  Self-managed environments allow organizations to schedule cluster upgrades, implement custom snapshot/restore mechanisms, and design high availability or DR plans that align with internal policies and SLAs.
